We work at the interface between the mind, brain, machines and the external world, using in-vivo electrophysiology, behavioral measurements (including eye-tracking) and computational modeling. We work with both humans and non-human primates as well as with open datasets, and much of our research focus is on the neurophysiological and computational basis of hearing, vision, eye-movements, and mental processes (e.g. attention), with a keen eye on direct applications to devices, algorithms and human health.
